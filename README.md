## Apache-Server-Status
The Apache Server-Status module provides an instrumentation tool set to determine how well the Apache server instance is performing.
Apache web server exposes metrics through its status module, mod_status. If your server is running and mod_status is enabled, your serverâ€™s status page should be available at http://{host}/server-status. If that link does not work, it means you need to enable mod_status in your configuration file.
